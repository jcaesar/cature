cature.js -- phantomjs steamgifts.com bot

Script for http://steamgifts.com - enters giveaways on the front page.
I hacked the whole thing together in two days, so it is not exactly a beauty. It has been extended to be able to walk through two factor authorization.

The script wants a file named settings in the directory it is run in. Following JSON format:

{
	"SNM": "steam username",
	"SPW": "steam password, wrapped by quatruple application of btoa (i.e., btoa(btoa(btoa(btoa('pw-string')))))",
	"Fav": [
		"list of regexes",
		"applied to game urls",
		"those games are selected in a favourized manner",
		"e.g.",
		"grand.*theft.*auto",
	]
}


I run it through cron, e.g.

37 9-23/2 * * *	cd $HOME/cature; phantomjs --cookies-file=$HOME/cature/steamgift_cookies.txt cature.js

The cookies-file is not strictly-speaking necessary, but it will save going through the steam auth every time.
